# TFG_XGBoost_Federated
This repository contains files for my final degree project, "Federated Learning for Performance Estimation in Mobile Networks." It estimates LTE Advanced cell-level throughput using XGBoost with a federated setup. The federated model adapts a public GitHub repo to this project with custom dataset, hyperparameters, evaluation metrics, and workflow.
